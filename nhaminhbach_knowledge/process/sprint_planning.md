## AI-Optimized Sprint Management

Sprint planning creates focused 2-6 hour work cycles that maximize AI-human collaboration efficiency while delivering tangible business value.

## Sprint Structure

### Duration & Scope
- **Timeline:** 2-6 hours maximum for rapid iteration
- **Task Count:** 3-6 tasks per sprint for manageable scope
- **Focus:** Single coherent objective with clear user/technical value
- **Naming:** `YYMMDD_sprint_name.md` format based on start date

### Sprint Types
- **Feature Sprints:** New functionality for users
- **Infrastructure Sprints:** Technical foundation and tooling
- **Polish Sprints:** UX/performance optimization
- **Integration Sprints:** System connectivity and data flow

## Planning Process

### 1. Epic Alignment
- **Context Review:** Ensure sprint advances epic objectives
- **Priority Assessment:** Focus on highest-impact sprint outcomes
- **Dependency Analysis:** Verify prerequisite sprints completed
- **Resource Planning:** Identify required AI agents and human involvement

### 2. Task Decomposition
- **Objective Breakdown:** Split sprint goal into 30min-2hr tasks
- **Dependency Sequencing:** Order tasks by logical implementation flow
- **AI Agent Assignment:** Match task complexity to appropriate AI agent
- **Success Criteria:** Define clear completion metrics for each task

### 3. Sprint Preparation
- **Context Package:** Gather all reference files AI agents will need
- **Integration Points:** Identify system touchpoints and APIs
- **Risk Assessment:** Plan for potential blockers and escalation points
- **Validation Strategy:** Define how sprint success will be measured

## Sprint Execution

### Daily Rhythm
- **Morning:** Sprint status review and AI agent context loading
- **Work Cycles:** Focused task execution with minimal context switching
- **Evening:** Progress assessment and next-day preparation
- **Flexibility:** Adjust task scope based on actual progress

### AI Agent Coordination
- **Context Handoffs:** Seamless knowledge transfer between AI agents
- **Shared References:** Common context files maintain consistency
- **Human Escalation:** Clear protocols for decisions requiring human input
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time sprint dashboard updates

## Sprint Completion

### Success Validation
- **Functional Testing:** All features work end-to-end as intended
- **Integration Testing:** Sprint output integrates with existing system
- **User Value Verification:** Sprint delivers promised user/business value
- **Technical Quality:** Code meets engineering principles and standards

### Sprint Retrospective
- **AI Performance Analysis:** Evaluate AI agent effectiveness and learning
- **Process Optimization:** Identify workflow improvements for future sprints
- **Knowledge Capture:** Document reusable patterns and anti-patterns
- **Epic Progress Update:** Reflect sprint completion in epic tracking

## Sprint Handoffs

### Epic Coordination
- **Epic Progress:** Update epic tracking with sprint outcomes
- **Strategic Alignment:** Ensure sprint outcomes advance epic vision
- **Next Sprint Preparation:** Context preparation for subsequent sprints
- **Cross-Epic Dependencies:** Manage dependencies between different epics

### Continuous Improvement
- **Velocity Tracking:** Monitor actual vs. estimated sprint duration
- **Task Size Optimization:** Refine task decomposition based on experience
- **AI Agent Evolution:** Improve AI agent instructions and context loading
- **Human-AI Balance:** Optimize division of work between human and AI agents
