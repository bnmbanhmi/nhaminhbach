# S8: The QC Cockpit & Public Launch

## 🎯 Sprint Goal
To build the essential human interface for data quality control and to launch the public-facing MVP. This sprint has two equally critical objectives: 1) Empower the human QC operator (the founder) to efficiently review, correct, and approve listings. 2) Deliver the core, usable product to the first set of users.

**Definition of Done for Sprint:**
- [ ] QC Dashboard displays all 'pending_review' listings with intuitive interface
- [ ] Side-by-side review UI shows raw text vs structured data for easy comparison
- [ ] Approve/Edit/Reject functionality fully operational with proper state management
- [ ] Public filtering system operational for location, price, and key attributes
- [ ] Full responsive design implemented across all interfaces
- [ ] Source post links displayed on public listing detail pages
- [ ] Application successfully used by first 10 external users

## 📋 Sprint Backlog & Task Progress

### 🚀 Primary Tasks - Part 1: The QC Cockpit
- [ ] **[[build_the_qc_dashboard_ui]]**: Develop the internal admin interface that queries and displays all listings with the status `'pending_review'`

- [ ] **[[implement_the_side_by_side_review_ui]]**: For each listing, the UI must present a clear "before-and-after" view: the original raw text on one side, and the structured, editable form fields (generated by the Transformation Engine) on the other

- [ ] **[[develop_approve_edit_reject_functionality]]**: Implement the core state-changing actions. The operator must be able to edit any structured field and then commit the changes via an "Approve" (sets status to `'available'`) or "Reject" (deletes or archives the listing) action

### 🚀 Primary Tasks - Part 2: The Public Launch Features
- [ ] **[[implement_basic_filtering_system]]**: Develop the public-facing filtering system for location, price, and key attributes

- [ ] **[[ensure_full_responsive_design]]**: Ensure all public and internal interfaces are fully functional and usable on mobile devices

- [ ] **[[display_source_post_link]]**: Add the source link to the public listing detail page
