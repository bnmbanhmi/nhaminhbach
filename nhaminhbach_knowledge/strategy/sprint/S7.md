# S7: The Public Launch Sprint

## 🎯 Goal
To complete the final, non-negotiable features required for a public MVP launch. The singular objective is to transform the existing data display into a usable product that solves the user's core problem: finding a relevant rental property efficiently. The "Definition of Done" for this sprint is a product ready for its first 10 real users.

## ✅ Key Tasks
-   **[[implement_basic_filtering_system]]**: This is the top priority. The task is to develop a functional filtering system that allows users to narrow down listings based on:
    1.  **Location:** By District (`address_district`)
    2.  **Price:** By a defined price range (`price_monthly_vnd`).
    3.  **Core Attributes:** By a minimum of 3-5 essential boolean attributes (e.g., "Air Conditioner", "Water Heater", "Pets Allowed").

-   **[[ensure_full_responsive_design]]**: Systematically refactor all UI components, especially the new filtering interface, to ensure a seamless and intuitive experience on mobile devices. More than 80% of initial traffic is expected to be mobile; a broken mobile UI is a project failure.

-   **[[display_source_post_link]]**: Implement the UI element on the `ListingDetailPage` that provides a direct, functional link to the original source post (e.g., on Facebook). This is a critical feature for building initial user trust and transparency.

## 📈 Success Metrics
-   **Metric 1:** All three key tasks are deployed to production and fully functional.
-   **Metric 2:** The application can be handed to 10 prospective users who can successfully filter for and identify a suitable listing without any guidance.
-   **Metric 3:** The filtering API response time remains under 500ms under simulated load.

## ❗ Strategic Context
This is the final sprint of Epic 2, [[E2]]. It represents the last leg of the race before we can gather real-world user feedback. All other potential features from the roadmap are to be ignored. The focus is absolute: deliver usability to unlock value.
