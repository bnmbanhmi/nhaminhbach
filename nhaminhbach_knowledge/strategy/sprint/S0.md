# S0: The Foundation

## 🎯 Goal
-   To establish a complete, production-ready technical and operational foundation for the project before writing the first line of feature code. The goal is to maximize future development velocity by investing in a robust architecture, clear principles, and defined processes upfront.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
-   [[define_lean_business_model]]: Solidified the core problem, customer segments, and unique value proposition.
-   [[establish_product_roadmap]]: Outlined a phased approach from MVP to a long-term vision, focusing on delivering value incrementally.
-   [[select_core_tech_stack]]: Made the strategic decision to build within the Google Cloud / Firebase ecosystem.
-   [[design_database_schema_v2]]: Iterated from a simple schema to a flexible, attribute-based model (V2) capable of handling future requirements without modification.
-   [[provision_gcp_infrastructure]]: Successfully set up all core cloud services, including Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, and Artifact Registry.
-   [[define_engineering_principles]]: Established the core technical tenets of the project, such as "Defense in Depth" and "Zero Warning Tolerance".
-   [[create_ai_agent_directives]]: Authored the foundational `copilot-instructions.md` file to ensure AI-generated code adheres to our high standards.
-   [[establish_sprint_operating_protocol]]: Defined and agreed upon the collaboration protocol between us.

## ⏪ Retrospective
-   **What went well?**
    -   The initial "whiteboard session" was highly effective. We dedicated significant time to architecture and schema design before touching any infrastructure, which prevented costly mistakes later on.
    -   The iterative process for the database schema was a major success. Challenging the initial, simpler design led to the far more robust and scalable V2 attribute model.
    -   Our rigorous approach to defining principles and processes upfront provided immediate clarity and discipline.

-   **What went wrong?**
    -   We encountered significant, predictable friction with GCP's IAM and networking configurations. While expected, the debugging cycles for permissions and service-to-service communication consumed more time than anticipated.
    -   The initial distinction between my role as a strategic partner (Alex) and the role of the AI Coding Agent was slightly ambiguous until we explicitly defined the `[[agent_interaction_protocol]]`.

-   **Key Principle Learned:** The entire sprint was an exercise in establishing our core tenets, which are now codified in [[engineering_principles]] and [[operating_principles]].

-   **Key Processes Created:** We successfully created and validated the [[agent_interaction_protocol]] and the overarching [[development_cycle]], which includes this retrospective process.

-   **Key Documents Involved:** This sprint was foundational, directly creating or refining the [[lean_business_model]], [[product_roadmap]], [[core_architecture]], and [[database_schema_and_model]].
