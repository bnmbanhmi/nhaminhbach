# E1: Foundation & Data Factory

## 🎯 Goal
-   To build a complete, resilient, and scalable technical foundation and a semi-automated data acquisition pipeline. The objective is to create the core asset of the company—the "Data Factory"—before launching any public-facing features.

## 📈 Success Metrics
-   Metric 1: Successfully deploy and operate all core GCP infrastructure (Cloud SQL, Run, Pub/Sub, Scheduler) without critical failures.
-   Metric 2: The local scraper can successfully acquire raw data, and the `ingest_scraped_data` API can process and queue it for QC with 100% reliability.
-   Metric 3: The internal QC Cockpit is fully functional, allowing the founder to enrich, approve, and manage listings.
