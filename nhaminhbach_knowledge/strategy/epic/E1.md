# AI Epic: E1: Foundation & Data Factory

**Duration:** 2025-07-01 to 2025-08-18 (7 weeks)  
**Business Impact:** High  
**Technical Complexity:** High

## 🎯 Epic Vision (AI Strategic Context)
**Business Outcome:** Build a complete, resilient, and scalable technical foundation and semi-automated data acquisition pipeline  
**User Impact:** Enables reliable data ingestion and quality control for housing marketplace  
**Technical Evolution:** Establishes core GCP infrastructure and data processing architecture

## 🎭 User Story (AI Understanding)
**As a** housing marketplace founder  
**I want** a reliable data factory that ingests, processes, and quality-controls housing listings  
**So that** I can focus on user experience while ensuring high-quality data feeds the platform

**User Journey:** Raw data → Ingestion API → Processing Pipeline → QC Review → Public Availability

## 📈 Success Criteria (AI Validation)
**Business Metrics:**
- Successfully deploy and operate all core GCP infrastructure without critical failures
- Local scraper can acquire raw data with 100% reliability
- Internal QC Cockpit is fully functional for data management

**Technical Metrics:**
- API response time < 500ms for data ingestion
- Zero data loss during processing pipeline
- 99.9% uptime for core infrastructure services

**AI Implementation Quality:**
- All infrastructure as code with proper documentation
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- Complete test coverage for critical data flows

## 🗺️ Sprint Strategy (AI Execution Plan)

### **Phase 1: Foundation** (Weeks 1-3)
**Objective:** Core infrastructure and basic data flow
